#Project 1 
'''
Distance Traveled 
ask for speed and hours for distance 
display distance the vehicle traveled
each hour of that time period
'''
#get user input 
speed = int(input("What is the speed of the vehicle in mph?\n"))
hours = int(input("How many hours has it traveled?\n"))

#print the table headings 
print('\nHour\tDistance traveled')
print('--------------------------')

#print the hours and distance traveled 
for time in range(1,hours +1):
    #Calculate Distance traveld 
    distance = speed*time
    print(f'{time}\t{distance}')
    
#works!

#Project 2
'''
Average Rainfall
nested loops, collect data
calculate average rainfall over period of years
inner loop iterate 12 times 
Ask inches of rainfall for every 12 months 
display total inches of rainfall 
average rainfall per month 
'''

MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12

#get number of years 
num_of_years = int(input('How many years long is your data?\n'))

#Determine each years average rainfall 
for years in range(num_of_years):
    #initialize for number of years
    total =0.0 
    #Display the year number 
    print(f'YEAR : {years+1}')
    print('--------------------------')
    
    #Get inches of rainfall for every month 
    for month in range(MONTHS_IN_YEAR):
        print(f'inches of rainfall for month {month+1}',end='')
        total_inches = float(input(': '))
        
        #add all total of inches 
        total += total_inches
    
    #Calculate the average of rainfall per month 
    average = total/MONTHS_IN_YEAR
    
    #Display the average
    print(f'The total inches of rainfall per year {years+1}' f' is: {total}')
    print(f'The average rainfall per year {years +1}' f' is: {average:.1f}')
    print()

#works!

#Project 3 
'''
Sums of Numbers 
ask user to enter a series of positive numbers 
user input a negative number to end the series
program should display the sum of the numbers 
'''
total =0.0 
#Tell user directions 
print('This program will calculate positive numbers.')
print('If you wish to stop enter a negative number.\n')

#User input 
number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
#while loop to use the >= 
while number >=0:
    total += number
    number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
#Print the total 
print('\nThe total of all the numbers you entered is ',total)

#works!
